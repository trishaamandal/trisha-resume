\begin{rSection}{PROJECTS}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\href{https://github.com/trishaamandal/tracking_number}{Resume Categorisation}} {This project focuses on automating resume screening and candidate matching using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN. The system helps HR professionals save time by quickly processing large volumes of resumes, ensuring unbiased evaluations, and improving the accuracy of job matches based on candidate skills, experience, and qualifications. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system extracts essential features from resumes and classifies candidates accordingly. Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 99.48 in testing. The solution integrates seamlessly with existing HR tools and supports multiple CV formats, offering a scalable, efficient, and reliable tool for recruitment. }
